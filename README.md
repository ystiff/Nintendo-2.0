#  Cube Game 
<html>
<article>
<h2> Motivation </h2>
<p> 
To create a simple game that is interactive with the user, implementing object-oriented principles.
</p>
<h2> Expected Output </h2>
<p>
The output depends in the player's choice of cube, within a set of cubes with suits that range from A to H,
a random integer value with range 1-10 will be displayed if the option is still available and is going to be added to the player's score.
The game will end when no cubes are left to choose. The player with the highest score wins. Ties are possible. <div>
Each time a player enters a non-available option a message will pop-up saying so, allowing to choose again. 
</p>
<h2> Options </h2>
<ul>
    <li> Player Vs. CPU </li>
    <li> Multiplayer (up to 2) </li>
</ul>
